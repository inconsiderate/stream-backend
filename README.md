Stream is a new tab replacement, and website 'reminder' service in one. Not only will your New Tab page be replaced, but you will also find a handy new Stream icon to the right of your URL bar. Clicking this icon will save the currently displayed website to your Stream homepage. Save now, read later!

Do you frequently save a website, thinking you'll read the article later... and then promptly forget all about it?!
STREAM! For IN YOUR FACE bookmarking.

This project was built in two parts. This is the backend logic for Stream. The source for the front facing Chrome extension can be found at https://github.com/inconsiderate/stream-extension
